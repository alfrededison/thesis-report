\chapter{Image Capturing Method}

\section{Screen Capture}
After using Screen Projection software on computer, the application captures what appears on screen and uses for processing.

For Android, Droid@Screen \cite{droid_screen} is an open-source Java-based program letting us capture Android screen without special permission or software installed.

\section{Continuously File Reading}
One of the most highlighted advantages of Droid@Screen is capturing phone screen sequentially in origin resolution. However, the original version at the time I am writing this thesis does not support saving output image with the same name. Therefore, I have changed a bit to make captured image in one place. This modification makes room for the application tracking phone screen more conveniently.
