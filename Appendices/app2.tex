\subsection{Install Java}
Droid@Screen is a Java program, so you need to have Java installed. Get the Java installer from Oracle and go for Java version 7 or later.

\subsection{Install and configure Android SDK}
Download and install the Android SDK. You can choose the one with or without IDE depending on your need for building Android application or not.
\newline
After successful installation, open SDK Manager and install Android SDK platform-tools

\subsection{Launch Droid@Screen}
