\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
Mobile application testing brings a lot of challenges. Regular \acrshort{os} updates, platform or device fragmentation and many other aspects contribute to the low quality of many mobile applications. This thesis focuses and described a testing system that applies Robotics technology for improving mobile application testing process.

\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Thesis contributions}
During the thesis elaboration, I have learned a lot of image processing techniques, robot control likewise application developing and testing.
I developed a program implemented the early mentioned testing system. Also did I modify a mobile screen mirroring application for better access of the program.
\newline
The contribution of this thesis includes several aspects listed as below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The implementation of automated mobile testing framework using Robotics technology.
		\item[-] The testing result performed on actual device and application.
	\end{itemize}
